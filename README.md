# Christmas Countdown Plugin

A festive LEDMatrix plugin that displays a countdown to Christmas with a stylized Christmas tree logo and holiday text.

## Features

- **Stylized Christmas Tree**: Displays a pixel-art style Christmas tree logo (image or programmatically drawn)
- **Adaptive Text Display**: 
  - Large displays: "N DAYS UNTIL CHRISTMAS"
  - Small displays (width < 64px): "N DAYS UNTIL XMAS"
- **Merry Christmas Message**: Automatically shows "MERRY CHRISTMAS" on and after December 25th
- **Traditional Colors**: Green tree, red text with white accents
- **Customizable**: Configurable colors and tree size

## Configuration

The plugin supports the following configuration options:

### Basic Settings

- `enabled` (boolean, default: `false`): Enable or disable the plugin
- `display_duration` (number, default: `15`): How long to display the countdown in seconds (1-300)
- `update_interval` (integer, default: `3600`): How often to update the countdown in seconds (60-86400). Default is 1 hour since the countdown changes daily.


```

## Display Behavior

### Countdown Display

- Before December 25th: Shows "N DAYS UNTIL CHRISTMAS" (or "N DAYS UNTIL XMAS" on small displays)
- On December 25th: Shows "MERRY CHRISTMAS"
- After December 25th: Shows "MERRY CHRISTMAS" (countdown to next year's Christmas)

### Layout

- Christmas tree logo is centered horizontally and positioned in the upper portion of the display
- Countdown text is centered below the tree
- Layout automatically adjusts for different display sizes

### Display Size Detection

- Displays with width < 64 pixels automatically use "XMAS" instead of "CHRISTMAS" to fit the text
- Tree size is automatically calculated based on display height (25-40% of height)
- All content is centered for optimal viewing

## Assets

The plugin includes a stylized Christmas tree image at `assets/christmas_tree.png`. If the image is not found, the plugin will automatically draw a simple tree programmatically.

To regenerate the tree image, run:
```bash
python3 generate_tree_image.py
```

## Dependencies

- Python 3.7+
- PIL/Pillow (for image handling)
- LEDMatrix 2.0.0 or higher

No additional Python packages are required beyond what LEDMatrix provides.

## Troubleshooting

### Tree Image Not Displaying

If the tree image doesn't appear:
1. Check that `assets/christmas_tree.png` exists in the plugin directory
2. The plugin will automatically fall back to programmatic drawing if the image is missing
3. Verify file permissions allow reading the image file

### Countdown Not Updating

- The countdown updates based on `update_interval` (default: 1 hour)
- The countdown changes once per day, so hourly updates are sufficient
- Check the plugin logs for any errors

### Text Not Fitting

- On small displays (width < 64px), the plugin automatically uses "XMAS" instead of "CHRISTMAS"
- If text still doesn't fit, reduce `tree_size` in configuration
- The plugin automatically adjusts layout based on display dimensions
